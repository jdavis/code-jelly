> Practice and Solutions to Google's Code Jam

## About
Google's 2013 [Code Jam][Code Jam] is coming up! This is where I practice for it and solve
some past problems.

## Style Guide
As with almost all the languages Google uses, they have provided a style guide
for C++. I have tried to follow it as closely as possible. To see the guide, go
[here](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml).

## Usage
Each problem is self contained. Each contains the problem description, sample
input, small input, and large input (when available).

To run each problem, just issue one of the commands below:

```sh
    # cd into the desired problem's directory
    cd africa2010/store-credit/

    # Make and run with sample input
    make sample

    # Make and run with small input
    make small

    # Make and run with large input
    make large

    # Clean up the directory
    make clean
```
